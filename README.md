# Amphibian-Longevity-Activity-and-Size-Influence
Data analysis with a dataset obtained from the AmphiBIO database. The goal in this analysis is to find the influence of activity and size of Amphibians and their lifespan. Using various plots to analyze data, ultimately concluding if there are any correlations between daytime/nighttime activity and body size with longevity in Amphibians.
